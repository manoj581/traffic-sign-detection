Python Project on Traffic Signs Recognition with 95% Accuracy using CNN & Keras


# Python Project – Traffic Signs Recognition 

You must have heard about the self-driving cars in which the passenger can fully depend on the car for traveling. But to achieve level 5 autonomous, it is necessary for vehicles to understand and follow all traffic rules.

In the world of Artificial Intelligence and advancement in technologies, many researchers and big companies like Tesla, Uber, Google, Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, Ford, Audi, etc are working on autonomous vehicles and self-driving cars. So, for achieving accuracy in this technology, the vehicles should be able to interpret traffic signs and make decisions accordingly.

# What is Traffic Signs Recognition?
There are several different types of traffic signs like speed limits, no entry, traffic signals, turn left or right, children crossing, no passing of heavy vehicles, etc. Traffic signs classification is the process of identifying which class a traffic sign belongs to.

# Traffic Signs Recognition – About the Python Project
In this Python project example, we will build a deep neural network model that can classify traffic signs present in the image into different categories. With this model, we are able to read and understand traffic signs which are a very important task for all autonomous vehicles.
